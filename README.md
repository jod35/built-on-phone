# Built on mobile

This is a simple petty project that I built to experiment if I could code a working web app on my mobile phone (Tecno Pop2 Power)

I built this just to experiment if I could be able to code on a smartphone. Luckily, it all worked well.

## Tools I used
 * Termux (terminal emulator for Android)
 * Vim (terminal based text editor)
 * Python3
 * Flask (web framework)
